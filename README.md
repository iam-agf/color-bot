### color_profile

Generator of profile pictures for using palettes from `palett.es` API.

### usage

Run 
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

So you can install the libraries needed to run the script. 

To use your bot in Telegram, look for the name you put to it and write `/start`, then send a number between 1 and 5. You will receive an image with that number of colors from a random palette.
